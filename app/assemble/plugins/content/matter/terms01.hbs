  {{dt "Payment:"}}
  {{#dd}} "We accept payment via Paypal as well as credit card payments made via Paypal. It’s not necessary to have a Paypal account in order to make credit card payments. A deposit of 50% is required before the design process will begin on any project. Full payment on any design project must be received before installation of design is made or files emailed."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Refunds:"}}
  {{#dd}} "No refunds are allowed unless a project is canceled by {{site.domain}}. In that case, we would refund your deposit in full. However, we will not issue refunds for any other reason due to the nature of our services."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Copyright:"}}
  {{#dd}} "Copyright for logos and custom graphics will be transferred to the client upon completion of the project, however, {{site.domain}} does require that the design itself be kept intact and unaltered after installation. It is also understood that when a client purchases a blog or web site design, it is for use on a single domain. The client may not use the design on multiple domains unless he/she has purchased the right to do so. If the client would like to make changes to the design after installation, they should contact {{site.domain}}. In addition, if another designer would like make changes to the client’s custom design, they must first seek written permission from {{site.domain}} otherwise start over with a completely new design. The client maintains the responsibility to adhere to U.S.A Copyrights Laws."{{/dd}}
  {{#dd}} "After the installation of the design, a small button crediting {{site.domain}} for the blog or website design will be placed in a sidebar. The client may relocate the button but not remove it altogether. The client must also keep a small footer attribution at the bottom of the blog or website crediting {{site.domain}} for the custom design. This small credit must stay in place for the length of time the client uses the design created especially for them by {{site.domain}}."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "New Project Questionnaire"}}
  {{#dd}} "All clients must submit a New Project Questionnaire before the design process will begin. Filling out the New Project Questionnaire as completely and thoroughly as possible helps us to better understand the scope of your project. It also helps us to determine whether or not a project is a good fit for {{site.domain}} as we reserve the right to refuse any project for any reason."{{/dd}}
  {{dt "Acceptance of Terms of Service"}}
  {{#dd}} "Once client has filled out the New Project Questionnaire and made deposit, the client agrees to all terms of service as stated here whether or not they have read them."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Scheduling"}}
  {{#dd}} "After {{site.domain}} has determined that your project is a good fit and the deposit has been made, you will be scheduled on our design calendar. We will notify you when we begin working on your project."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Time Frame"}}
  {{#dd}} "You can expect your design to be complete within 7&#8211;14 days of notifying you that we’ve begun work on your project, and we have received any specific items from you that you would like used in your design (i.e. photographs). It is vital to keep in constant contact via email during this time. We will need your feedback so that we can design your project to your delight. The time frame, however, could be longer depending on revisions, but most of the time you can expect you site to be finished within 1&#8211;2 weeks."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Revisions"}}
  {{#dd}} "All blog and website design packages and elements include up to 2 major revisions. After that, client will be charged $45 per additional major revision. A major revision, for example, would be a blog header or background or a completely new mockup of the site."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Email/Communication"}}
  {{#dd}} "In the design process, communication is key. Communication will be made back and forth via email. If, however, we are working on your project and do not hear from you for 72 hours, your project may be put back into the queue and rescheduled for a later date."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Browsers"}}
  {{#dd}} "We guarantee that your design will be compatible with the latest browsers. Your design will be tested in the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. We can not guarantee that your design will always be compatible with older outdated browsers."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Blogger to WordPress Migration"}}
  {{#dd}} "Client understands that while all posts can be imported from Blogger to WordPress, it isn’t always the case when it comes to comments."{{/dd}}

  {{dt "Portfolio Agreement"}}
  {{#dd}} "Client agrees to allow {{site.domain}} to use the design created for them in our portfolio unless client states otherwise during the design process. In that case, we would not feature your design in our portfolio."{{/dd}}
